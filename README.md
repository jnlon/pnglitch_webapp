# pnglitch\_webapp
pnglitch\_webapp is an FCGI program for "glitching" PNG image files. 
This program was made for a school project, and a demo can be found [here](http://pnglitch.xyz).
This project was inspired by [The art of PNG Glitch](https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/).

# building

Execute `make` in the project's root directory.

# usage

This program requires a properly configured FCGI compatible webserver to be useful.
If you would like a more practical, commandline version of this program to run
yourself, see [this other repository](https://github.com/spinclick/pnglitch).
